-you do this by 1. right clickproject then create a branch here
		2. now do your changes, once done, push it.
		3. it will ask you to automatically create a branch for you at github.
		4. go to github and you will see you have now 2 branches.
		5. your master(original) branch will not have the changes you have on the branch
		   you created.
		6. if you think your done editing because you already pushed, do a pull request
		   now by merging the branch you made with the master branch at gitkraken.
		7. now check your pull request on github, and there your teammates can comment
		   on your request and ask for revisions, if you have revisions, just push it again
		   at gitkraken and it will auto add at github in the branch you created
		   but once satisfied, you can now click the merge pull request and also delete 
		   the branch on github if you want.
